## Usage

Simple application in nextjs that retrieves information from shopify and creates a simple listing/product.

No custom hooks or reduxes were used for manipulation.

For the graphic part has been used tailwind.

It has no interfaces even if it is typed.

There are no files for testing the component.

This application will not be maintained in any way.
